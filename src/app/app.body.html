            <p>In the quiet town of Marrowfield, time moved slowly — almost too slowly. The cobblestone streets echoed the same footsteps every morning, and the bell tower rang with such precision that people rarely checked their own watches. At the corner of Elm Street stood a tiny shop, known simply as Hollis & Timepieces. Inside worked an old clockmaker named Edwin Hollis, who was said to have built a clock that never needed winding.</p>

So each morning, as the sun rose through the dusty glass windows, Edwin would carefully polish gears, align springs, and whisper small apologies to the clocks that refused to tick.</p>

The glass was cracked, the hands were frozen, and the engraving on the back had almost faded away. “I can fix it,” he said after a pause, “but it might take more than time.”</p>
